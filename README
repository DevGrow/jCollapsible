Plugin Name: jCollapsible

jCollapisble is a JQuery plugin that takes any nested list (OL or UL 
that have children) and coverts it into collapsible threads. This is 
especially useful to create simple threaded comments on a blog or forum 
without having to modify the backend code. I’ve tried to keep the 
plugin as simple and bare-bones as possible, so right now there are no 
fancy slide or fade effects. The only thing required is the plugin JS 
file itself – CSS and images are completely optional.

The plugin has been tested (and works fine) on Firefox 3, Chrome 5, 
IE7+, Safari 4 and Opera 10. It should work on older browsers too though 
the CSS may need to be fiddled with.v


USAGE
======

SliderNav is super easy to use, but first you have to load JQuery, the 
plugin and the relevant CSS file in order to use it:

  <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.4.2.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="jCollapsible.min.js"></script>
  <script type='text/javascript'> 
    $(document).ready(function(){
	$('#example').collapsible({xoffset:'-10',yoffset:'5',defaulthide: false});
    });
  </script>

Simple enough - just include JQuery (1.3.2 and up), the jCollapsible 
file and then call the function with your settings.


CUSTOM OPTIONS
==============

While I did try to keep the plugin lightweight, I also wanted to make it 
somewhat extensible by adding a few different options, including:

    * defaulthide	hide all children by default (default: true)
    * symbolhide	symbol to hide child elements (default: -)
    * symbolshow	symbol to show child elements (default: +)
    * imagehide		image to hide child elements (default: null)
    * imageshow		image to show child elements (default: null)
    * xoffset		amount pixels to move symbol/image horizontally (default: -15)
    * yoffset		amount pixels to move symbol/image vertically (default: 0)

Please note that the image values are null by default (using symbol 
instead) and the offset values are there to fine-tune the location of 
the image/symbol.
